## 📞 Call Center Performance Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard was created as part of a virtual internship with Forage to analyze the performance of a call center over a three-month period (January to March 2021). The goal was to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify ways to improve agent efficiency and service quality.

### 🔍 Objective

* Track agent-wise call handling performance.
* Monitor call volumes over time.
* Analyze customer satisfaction based on rating distribution.
* Identify areas for operational improvement such as resolution rate and speed of answer.

### 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: Provided during the Forage virtual internship.
* **Time Range**: January 1, 2021 – March 31, 2021.
* **Fields Included**: Agent name, call status, rating (1–5), call duration, speed of answer, resolution status, etc.
